    </table>Note: It is very important that you write things exactly as given. E.g. “myself” is not the same as “Myself”; do not put spaces where spaces are not found in the examples.4.4: Now modify program from the previous exercise in this tutorial and personalise it by stating what your hobbies or favourite pastimes and if you have seen or have any ideas on how to use programming in your hobby/pastime. Answers are not checked for correctness &#x1f642;4.5: Add code comments to your program and identify and explain the following terms in your own words: <strong>Class</strong>, <strong>method, </strong><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html"><strong>variable</strong></a> and a code <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/expressions.html"><strong>block</strong></a><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/expressions.html">.</a> Listen to the 26/8 live lecture as well.4.6: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjySN5eDEyQ&amp;list=PL-GM8dbPIbtmJJkpQcZdkgbfTjVrE3Wn2&amp;index=2&amp;t=4s">Submit</a> your Myself.java and a full screenshot of your entire Eclipse window via Canvas→Assignments→<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/56609/assignments/373780">Independent Investigative Effort 1</a> then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjySN5eDEyQ&amp;list=PL-GM8dbPIbtmJJkpQcZdkgbfTjVrE3Wn2&amp;index=2">verify your submission</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjySN5eDEyQ&amp;list=PL-GM8dbPIbtmJJkpQcZdkgbfTjVrE3Wn2&amp;index=2">.</a><strong>Important note on late submissions: </strong>As the tutorial solutions are discussed immediately after the deadline, a full mark cannot be awarded for submissions made after the deadline.
